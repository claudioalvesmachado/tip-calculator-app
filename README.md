## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS/SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript


### What I learned

I learned to use the ``` forEach() ``` method to select the buttons separately, and thus, make my code smaller and simpler, like this:

```js
tips.forEach((/**/) => {
        if (/**/) {
          ////////
        }
})
```

### Continued development

After completing this challenge, I was interested in learning a lot more about interactivity using javascript to make my projects more professional and functional.
